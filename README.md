This code is using the yfinance library to download historical data for a cryptocurrency specified by the user, and then it applies a custom indicator called "wiggle" to the data. The wiggle indicator calculates the difference between the cryptocurrency's closing price and a moving average of that closing price, and then normalizes it by the standard deviation of the closing price over a specified window. Then, it creates buy and sell signals based on a threshold for wiggle value. Finally, it plots the cryptocurrency's candlestick chart and the wiggle indicator chart, showing the buy and sell signals.
